        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Sarah. I'm learning web development, with the goals of one day becoming an inspiring software
          engineer in a thriving team environment. I strong passion for creative design and love hacking on ideas and
          building stuff in my free time.</br></br>
          First, a bit about me. I left home at 17, without understanding what I wanted to be or know how to get there.
          I managed to get into a few different types of roles in Accounting, Customer Services, Information Management
          and Construction. In each role I became the person whose colleagues would rely on for software or program
          training/development. I was able to pick things up very quickly and learn all the functions and short cuts. I
          used various Microsoft packages such as Excel, Word, Projects, Visio etc. I also used Sage Line 50, Sage
          Payroll, AutoCad and Oracles RS-SQL but I wanted to know how these programs works and how they were made.
          Throughout my career, I've often felt unfulfilled in my role and wanting to do more. I wasn't being mentally
          stimulated. I remember being bored at work and hitting the F12 key on any webpage I was on so I could inspect
          with DevTools. I wanted to know how it worked but I never had the confidence or know how. I thought this was
          something people went to university to study and that I had missed my chance.</br></br>
          My coding journey began in June 2019 due to curiosity, I signed up for a 4 week short course with Founders and
          Coders. It was an introduction to JavaScript and I knew immediately that this was what I wanted to do. The
          continuous growth and ever changing technology within the industry fills me with such enthusiasm and
          excitement. Whilst still in my previous employment I started attending meet-ups and completing courses online
          with Udemy, Free Code Camp and various other sites. Finally in October 2019 I enrolled in a full time Software
          Engineering course which covered a range of technologies. I graduated from this bootcamp in February 2020 and
          I still continue to further my knowledge by sttending conferences and meetups, completing more courses and
          creating my own projects.</br></br>
          My confidence has grown and now I want this more than ever. I'll do everything I can to prove to myself that I
          can make this transition. One day, I ultimately hope to be able to educate and influence others in this
          awesome community.</p>
